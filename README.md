##### Philosophy
I believe technology should empower humanity, not control it.  
My work challenges the status quo, promotes sustainability, and defends our collective right to innovate freely.

I pledge to uphold these principles in all my endeavors, ensuring that technology serves humanity. Should I stray from this path, I welcome accountability from my peers and community, recognizing that growth comes from reflection and responsibility.

Though **eudaimence** is my pseudonym, I aspire for it to represent something greater.
